# Probability of Default (PD) Modeling

This project builds an end-to-end baseline for Probability of Default (PD) prediction using a synthetic credit risk dataset.  
The goal is to compare multiple modeling approaches and select the best-performing model based on robust evaluation metrics.

## What’s inside
- Data loading and quick exploratory analysis (EDA)
- Basic preprocessing and feature handling
- Training and evaluation of multiple models (e.g., linear / tree-based / boosting-style approaches)
- Model comparison using classification metrics and validation strategy
- Final model selection and short conclusions
